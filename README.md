# Social API

## Description

This is the backend for a social media application. It uses a NoSQL database to store data about users and their thoughts. Users can create, update, and delete their own thoughts, as well as react to other users' thoughts. Users can also add and remove friends from their friend list, and update or delete their profiles.
